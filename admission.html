At Open Minds - A Birla School Kankarbagh, we aim to make our admission process as clear and straightforward as possible.
We recommend the first thing you to do is to come and see us. We are a welcoming family school and would be happy to show you around at a time that suits you during the academic year. You will have the opportunity to see our school in action, the stunning grounds and extensive on-site facilities, meet our teachers and, most importantly students. We can answer any question you have regarding any aspect of life at Open Minds.
If you then decide that Open Minds - A Birla School Kankarbagh, offers the setting, education and experiences that you prefer for your child, please visit our school to complete our Registration Form. At this stage a registration fee (non refundable) of Rs 1000 is payable.
We will then give you all the information you need regarding assessments, interviews and starting days to complete your child's application. This process will be different depending on the age of your child.
Upon receiving an offer of a place, admission form will be given to you.
